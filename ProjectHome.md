Covers most of the topics found in the Java 6 SCJP Professional Exam.

Each project represents a chapter found in the SCJP Sun® Certified Programmer for Java™ 6 Study Guide Exam (310-065). The contents of the chapters are not exactly 1 to 1 to the book. I grouped the most relevant material together rather than mentioning material sooner rather than earlier.

The classes are designed to be compact to mimic questions found on the exam. The classes are are also meant to be self-explanatory and experimented with.

Happy Reviewing!
